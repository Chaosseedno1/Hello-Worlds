It's the year 2006 inside a private christian school, in this school is a young boy with aspirations that seemed so large that He would never be able to obtain them wether that be a Firefighting a Police officer or even a proFootball player. hmm cough cough Joshua can I talk to you a moment? 
Slowly He looked up from His musing of the great future He would obtain. Yes Ms Pell(He replied to His 1st grade teacher).? Joshua have you ever thought about reading books? Yew thats so boring nobody reads books at my age He replied almost instantly. How do you know that? You ever try (replied Ms Pell)?
