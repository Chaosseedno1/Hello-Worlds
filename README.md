# Hello-Worlds
Hello their nice to see you drop in wanna hear a little story? If not its all good You can skip to the end for a brief summary but otherwise buckleup were going for a ride.

It's the year 2006 inside a private christian school, in this school is a young boy with aspirations that seemed so large that He would never be able to obtain them wether that be a Firefighting a Police officer or even a proFootball player. hmm cough cough Joshua can I talk to you a moment? 

Slowly He looked up from His musing of the great future He would obtain. Yes Ms Pell(He replied to His 1st grade teacher).? Joshua have you ever thought about reading books? Yew thats so boring nobody reads books at my age He replied almost instantly. How do you know that? You ever try asked Ms Pell? Well no He replied(Time skip about 3 days dont remember the specifics).

The day is Friday it's almost the end of the day about 2:30 the small library the school has at just outside the door of the 1st through 3rd graders is open. Joshua has thought long and hard and after there teacher Ms pell gave them the goahead to go to the library He walked into the library to see if there were any books of interest (Adventure books) one thing turned into another and Joshua walked out with a 180 page adventure/Mystery book called the Island Jungle by Lee Roddy
